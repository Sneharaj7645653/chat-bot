# MERN Stack AI Chatbot ü§ñ

A full-stack, real-time chatbot application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrated with the Google Gemini API. The app features user authentication via email OTP and allows users to create, manage, and delete their conversations.

‚ú® Features
* Real-time AI Chat: Get instant and accurate responses from the Google Gemini API for a natural, conversational experience.
* Secure User Authentication: Employs a secure login system using email-based OTP (One-Time Password) verification and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
* Full Conversation Management:
    * Chat History: All conversations are saved to the user's account and can be accessed from a persistent sidebar.
    * Create & Delete: Users can create new, separate chat sessions or delete old ones with a single click.
    * Persistent Messages: All messages (questions and answers) are saved in the MongoDB database, allowing users to pick up where they left off.
* Polished User Interface (UI/UX):
    * Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
    * Auto-Scrolling Chat: The chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom when a new message is sent or received, keeping the latest content in view.
